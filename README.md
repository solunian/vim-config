# Vim Config Files

Clone the repo into your home directory and name it `.vim` for unix, `vimfiles` for 
Windows (idk why its different). Then copy the `.vimrc` to the home directory.
Just pull any new changes to update the config.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solunian/vim-config.git .vim
cp .vim/.vimrc .
```

Uses the [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/vim) theme that goes with the
tabline plugin [lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim).
